# Project Title

This web app is called UMD-Bulletin

## Description

This is a special kind of web application that allows University of Maryland Students to have all the announcements that they would ever need in one place. The app allows students to filter through the three categories that we have so far: clubs, departments and selling. In the club category you can see announcements from specific clubs, similarly for departments and for selling. It also allows you to filter based on certain criterias that may be of interest to you.

## Usage

Go to the dest folder and use Visual Studio Code Live Server Extension to run index.html. The backend is already configured with an EC2 instance so there is no need to worry about it. To run the dev build for the project you will need to cd into the frontend folder and then run npm i and after that run npm run dev.
